# VBA
Extension methods for Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)

# Why?
That's a very good question, why indeed?! Upon delving into VBA one rainy weekend of March 2015, it became apparent that what was lacking was a set of custom user defined functions (UDFs) that could expand the current VBA library, which had real world use. This is when the idea for ExVBA was born (name is currently tentative). The current functions that are implemented are based off of AutoIt (autoitscript.com), as their UDFs have been thoroughly tested and proven to be useful.
